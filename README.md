## Project Objective

Travelers waste hours researching what to pack, often forgetting essentials or over-packing for the wrong climate especially students going abroad or taking their first solo trip. **PackMate** solves this by letting travelers build and manage structured packing lists for their trips while the community contributes and upvotes real-world packing tips per trip type.

Users create a trip by entering their destination, climate, trip type, and duration, then build their packing list by selecting from a categorized master items database (Clothing, Electronics, Toiletries, Documents, Activity Gear) and adding custom items of their own. Community members who've traveled to similar destinations can share and upvote packing tips, which appear alongside each trip's list. Students save significant planning time by browsing proven community advice instead of starting from scratch — and after their trip, they contribute back, creating a self-improving feedback loop.
